summary: Presented at the LXIV Congreso Nacional De Física 
abstract: <div align="justify"> In this presentation, I present the preliminary results of the first project I led. In this study, we characterized the innermost gaseous layers of the atmosphere of an evolved star to understand the mechanisms driving mass loss. To achieve this, I employed various techniques, including (i) parametric fitting of the data and (ii) image reconstruction. </div>
