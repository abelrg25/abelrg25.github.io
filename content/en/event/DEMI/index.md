summary: Presentation given as part of the Colloquium of the Department of Stars and the Interstellar Medium (DEMI)
abstract: <div align="justify"> In this presentation, I provide a summary of the results from the first project I led. In this study, we characterized the innermost gaseous layers of the atmosphere of an evolved star using various techniques, including geometric modeling, image reconstruction, theoretical models with Monte Carlo methods to extract physical parameters, among others (See the Papers section). </div>
