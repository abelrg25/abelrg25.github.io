title: ðŸ“Š Applied Machine Learning in Python
summary: In this certification, I learned and applied a variety of machine learning techniques, ranging from supervised learning for classification and regression to unsupervised learning for clustering and dimensionality reduction. I also learned how to evaluate model performance using techniques such as the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), as well as recall, precision, accuracy, and cross-validation, among others.
