      title: 'üìö Scientific Research & Data Analytics: My Experience'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        <div align="justify"> As a junior researcher in science, I led two independent projects that resulted in publications in high-impact international journals. Additionally, I collaborated with research groups across the globe, contributing to three more published papers.

        Throughout this time, I developed key skills such as proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries including Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Astropy, and Scikit-learn, along with visualization tools like Matplotlib, which allowed me to efficiently process, analyze, and present complex data. I also worked across multiple operating systems including MacOS, Linux, and Windows.

        I later completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate, where I strengthened my skills in SQL, Excel, R, and Tableau, enhancing my ability to manipulate data, build visualizations, and extract valuable business insights.

        üí° Personal Data Analysis Projects

        As part of my transition into applied data science, I‚Äôve developed projects focused on real-world challenges:
          ‚Ä¢	üìà Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis: Using SQL and Tableau, I explored a real dataset to identify key factors influencing customer conversion. I calculated KPIs by contact channel, age group, previous campaign history, and contact month, and built interactive dashboards to support business decision-making.
          ‚Ä¢	üå°Ô∏è Global Climate Change Analysis: I processed over 170 years of global temperature data using Python to detect trends, anomalies, and events like El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a. I applied rolling averages, linear regression, and comparative visualizations, producing narrative-rich graphics accessible to non-technical audiences.

        Both projects are clearly documented in my portfolio and reflect my commitment to applying data analysis across diverse, meaningful contexts.

        Finally, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to present my work at national and international conferences, both in Spanish and English, tailoring the communication style to audiences from various scientific and professional backgrounds.
