        <div align="justify"> As an Early Career Researcher, I led various projects that resulted in the publication of two research articles in high-impact journals worldwide. I also collaborated with international groups on different projects, leading to the publication of three additional scientific articles.

        During this period, I developed a range of skills, including a comprehensive understanding of **Python** and its various data analysis packages such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **SciPy**, **Astropy**, and **Scikit-learn**, as well as visualization tools like **Matplotlib**, which helped me prepare and interpret data effectively. I also gained experience working with operating systems such as **macOS**, **Linux**, and **Windows**.

        Additionally, I completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate, expanding my expertise in **SQL**, **Excel**, **R**, and **Tableau**. This allowed me to strengthen my ability to manipulate, visualize, and analyze data efficiently.

        Finally, I learned to present my results at various national and international conferences, in both English and Spanish, tailoring my communication for audiences from a wide range of scientific disciplines.
