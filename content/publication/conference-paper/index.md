abstract: Context. Stellar convection plays an important role in atmospheric dynamics, wind formation, and the mass-loss processes in asymptotic
  giant branch stars. However, a direct characterization of convective surface structures in terms of size, contrast, and lifespan is
  quite challenging, as spatially resolving these features requires the highest angular resolution.
  Aims. We aim to characterize the size of convective structures on the surface of the O-rich AGB star R Car to test different theoretical
  predictions based on mixing-length theory from solar models.
  Methods.We used infrared low-spectral resolution (R ~ 35) interferometric data in the H-band (~1.76 microns) obtained by the instrument
  PIONIER at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) to image the star’s surface at two epochs separated by approximately
  six years. Using a power spectrum analysis, we estimated the horizontal size of the structures on the surface of R Car. The sizes of the
  stellar disk at dfferent phases of a pulsation cycle were obtained using parametric model fitting in the Fourier domain.
  Results. Our analysis supports that the sizes of the structures in R Car are correlated with variations in the pressure scale height in the
  atmosphere of the target, as predicted by theoretical models based on solar convective processes. We observed that these structures
  grow in size when the star expands within a pulsation cycle. While the information is still scarce, this observational finding highlights
  the role of convection in the dynamics of those objects. New interferometric imaging campaigns with the renewed capabilities of the
  VLTI are envisioned to expand our analysis to a larger sample of objects.
