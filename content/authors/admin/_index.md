    summary: |
      During my Ph.D., I focused on the study of evolved stars known as AGBs (Asymptotic Giant Branch) using high-angular-resolution techniques. The objective of my doctoral research was to address the following questions as thoroughly as possible:
      1. What mechanisms drive mass loss and the formation of asymmetric gas and dust structures in AGB stars?
      2. How important is the chemical composition of the gas and dust surrounding these stars for wind formation? How does convection operate in stars other than the Sun?
      To this day, these questions remain unresolved. Although AGB stars are among the main contributors to the enrichment of the interstellar medium, the process by which processed material is returned to the interstellar medium remains poorly characterized.
      To tackle these questions, I obtained, reduced, and cleaned data from one of the worldâ€™s most important observatories, the VLTI. Additionally, I applied Monte Carlo methods, mathematical modeling, image visualization, and manipulation techniques. 
      Abstract thinking, combined with analytical and critical reasoning, played a crucial role in interpreting the results obtained by my collaborators and me. This work led to publications in high-impact journals, contributing to scientific progress.

      I studied the foundational concept of Data Science with python. By the end of the course, I was familiar with data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the python pandas data science library. I also learned about Series and DataFrames as the central data structures for data analysis. Furthermore, I also learned how to run basic inferential statistical analyses.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
